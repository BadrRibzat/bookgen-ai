Examples include classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples, such as clustering (grouping similar data points) or dimensionality reduction. The key difference is that supervised learning has a 'teacher' (labels) while unsupervised learning discovers hidden structures independently.",
