Compute population stability index (PSI) between training and production distributions weekly; a PSI above 0.25 indicates significant drift. Complement PSI with KL divergence for continuous features. When drift is detected, trigger a retraining workflow using the latest labelled data and update model cards with the monitoring results.",
