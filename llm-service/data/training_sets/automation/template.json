      "output": "RPA (Robotic Process Automation) uses software robots to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks by mimicking human interactions with digital systems. Unlike traditional automation that requires deep system integration and custom coding, RPA works at the user interface level, making it faster to implement and less disruptive. RPA bots can handle tasks like data entry, form filling, and moving information between systems without changing existing infrastructure.",
