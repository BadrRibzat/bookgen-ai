Proteins (4 cal/g) build and repair tissues, make enzymes and hormones, found in meat, dairy, legumes. Fats (9 cal/g) provide concentrated energy, support cell membranes, aid vitamin absorption, found in oils, nuts, fish. A balanced diet typically includes 45-65% carbs, 10-35% protein, and 20-35% fats for optimal health.",
