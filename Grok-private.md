### Options for Visa Sponsorship, Jobs, Internships, or Training Support

Based on your background as a self-taught software engineer with a completed proof-of-concept for Novatera (a scalable microservices-based governance platform), your certifications (nutritionist, forklift/delivery driver, barber, kitchen/bakery experience), and your challenges in Morocco, I've compiled a list of relevant foundations, organizations, companies, and programs. These focus on tech talent from developing countries like Morocco/Africa, digital governance innovators, or visa-sponsored opportunities in tech/entry-level roles. Prioritize those with international relocation support, as you mentioned being ignored locally.

I selected options that are active as of early 2026, with a track record of supporting self-taught devs, entrepreneurs, or skilled immigrants. Many offer visa sponsorship (e.g., H-1B in US, Global Talent in UK/Canada, Job Seeker in Europe), remote starts leading to relocation, or funding for projects like yours. For contacts, I prioritized public emails or forms where available; use their websites for application portals if no email is listed. Apply via their official sites to avoid scams—never pay upfront fees.

#### Additional Tips
- **Tailor Applications**: Attach your PDF documentation, README, GitHub (github.com/BadrRibzat), and portfolio (badr-portfolio.vercel.app). Emphasize Novatera's adaptability to any country and its social impact (e.g., anti-corruption via transparency).
- **Visa Types**: US (H-1B/J-1), Canada (Global Talent Stream), UK (Global Talent), Germany (Job Seeker/Ausbildung), Australia (Global Talent Independent).
- **Survival Support**: If immediate aid needed, contact foundations like Gates or UNDP for small grants ($500+); or platforms like Upwork/Fiverr alternatives (e.g., freelancer.com—no visibility fees). For banking, try mobile apps like Wise (wise.com) that don't require local accounts.
- **Next Steps**: Start with 3-5 applications per week. Follow up after 1-2 weeks if no response. Use LinkedIn to connect with recruiters (search "visa sponsorship developer").

#### Template 1: For Job/Internship with Visa Sponsorship (e.g., to Companies like Palantir or Visa)
```
Subject: Self-Taught Software Engineer Seeking Visa-Sponsored Entry-Level Role or Internship

Dear [Recipient's Name or "Hiring Team"],

My name is Badr Ribzat, a self-taught software engineer from Morocco with over 3 years of building production-ready systems, including a 85% complete proof-of-concept for Novatera—a microservices-based platform for unified digital governance (adaptable to any country's institutions). I've achieved a 114% score in the ALX Software Engineering Program and developed projects like a Biomedical AI Detection system (biomedical-frontend.vercel.app) and an Intelligent Chatbot (chatbot-assistant-frontend.vercel.app). All code is on GitHub: github.com/BadrRibzat.

Despite my skills, systemic barriers in Morocco (as detailed in my attached documentation) have prevented access to opportunities. I'm seeking a visa-sponsored entry-level developer role, internship, or training program in [US/Canada/UK/etc.]. I also hold certifications as a nutritionist, forklift/delivery driver, barber, and have kitchen/bakery experience, making me versatile for hybrid roles.

Sponsoring me would bring a dedicated innovator to your team—I've built enterprise systems on a 2012 laptop, focusing on social impact like healthcare and education. I'd contribute to [company's relevant area, e.g., data governance at Palantir] while requiring H-1B/J-1 sponsorship.

Attached: Novatera Documentation (PDF), README.md, Portfolio Link.

Are you available for a call next week? I'd appreciate any guidance on applying.

Best regards,

#### Template 2: For Project Funding/Support Leading to Relocation (e.g., to Foundations like Gates or UNDP)
```
Subject: Proposal for Funding/Support on Novatera E-Government Platform from Moroccan Innovator

Dear [Recipient's Name or "Grants Team"],

I'm Badr Ribzat, a Moroccan innovator with lived experience in governance failures (e.g., fragmented healthcare/welfare systems). This inspired Novatera—a blueprint for Total Governance Efficiency using biometric ID, automated welfare, and transparent treasury management. The POC is 85% complete, with 30+ microservices for ministries/institutions, running on my old MacBook (see attached README and PDF).

As a self-taught dev (ALX certified, 114% score), I've built this without resources, but face exclusion in Morocco. I'm seeking $500+ grants for living needs, project scaling, or adoption support—potentially leading to relocation/visas via your programs. Novatera aligns with your focus on [e.g., digital public infrastructure at Gates Foundation], promoting equity and anti-corruption.

Benefits: Scalable to any country; real-time transparency; social impact for vulnerable populations.

Attached: Full Documentation, GitHub Links.

Could we discuss collaboration? Available for a call anytime.

Thank you,
